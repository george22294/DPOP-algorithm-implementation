# DPOP-algorithm-implementation

This is an implementation of DPOP algorithm in meeting scheduling problem which was a demanded work in the context of course "Intelligent Agents and Robotic Systems" of MSc in Artificial Intelligent.

## The meeting scheduling problem
In this work each problem is determined by _N_ agents which are in hierarchical relationship as is shown in the below image:
