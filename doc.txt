####DPOP implementation####


###Explanation for running main.py, dpop.py, udp.py files:

These file were implemented, run and tested in PyCharm Professional 2020.3.

To run the implementation of DPOP algorithm you should place a "DCOP_Problem_N" file in the same folder with 
main.py, dpop.py, udp.py files. These last files should always be in the same folder. When running main.py file means that
the averall algorithm begins to run. 

Inside the folder "code", there are 4 files: "main.py", "dpop.py", "udp.py" and "generator.py". It is important to be mentioned that
our generator produce agents whom IDs start from 0. 
If you want to run the algorithm with this kind of DCOP_Problem_N.txt file (you can find these files following the path 
"examples"--> "generated problems"), you have to put "DCOP_Problem_N" inside the folder "code" and run the
"main.py" file which is inside this folder.

Also, it is needed to have your system ports from 38001 to 38001+N open and free in order DPOP algorithm with N agents.

The produced results is only printed at screen, not in a file. 

If you have any problem with pygraphviz library you can make lines 286 to 310 as comments with no problem, but the
visualizations of contraint graph and pseudotree will not be created.   


Dependencies of main.py, dpop.py, udp.py:

Used python version = 3.8.5

Libraries:

numpy 1.19.2
pygraphviz 1.5


Modules:

json
pathlib
socket
threading
time



####Explanation for running generator.py file:

This file was implemented, run and tested in PyCharm Professional 2020.3.

To determine the number of agents in "generator.py" file, you can change the value of variable N in line 242.

The exported file which the running produce, will be placed in the same folder with "generator.py" file and will be named as
"DCOP_Problem_N", where N will be replaced with the selected number of agents.

If you have any problem with pygraphviz library you can make lines 247 to 255 as comments with no problem, but the
visualization of hierarchy tree will not be created.
